"The Login Security System":
To start off the code it would be easier to create 4 separate functions in the code. The first functions would be about suspicious behavior, there would definitely be an if statement where if the user tried to login after 5 tries and an elif  statement where between 12:00 and 5:00, it is marked as specific behavior. I would also use dictionaries to figure out the total amount of suspicious activities in a day. The second function I would count the number of times the user logs in and has an if statement where if there are more logins than logouts the code would say that is irresponsible behavior. I would also use dictionaries in this case as well to count the number of times of irresponsible activity. The third function would have another if statement where if the number of logins is greater than the number of logouts the code would call it a glitch because itâ€™s simply not possible. The code would also use dictionaries to count the amount of glitches. For the fourth and final function to list all the domains would generate a list  and use the split function to put in three separate parts:Email-1D, Name, and Domain name
